//The script allows you to test popular candlestick patterns on various instruments and timeframes. In addition, you can configure risk management (if the value is zero, it means the function is disabled), and you can also specify the time of the trading session (for example, so that the positions are not transferred to the next day). 
//The author is grateful to JayRogers and Phi35, their code examples helped a lot in writing the strategy.
